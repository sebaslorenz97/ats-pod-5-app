Reflection: 
In this course about Angular I learn the main topics like the types of data binding this framework has which are Interpolation that allow me to use variables of the model in the template, Property Binding wich help to use variables of the model as attributtes of HTML elements in the template, Event Binding which add an event listener that once this is activated it will execute a method in the model. 

I also see the differences between Reactive Form and Template Form. Template-driven forms make use of the FormsModule, while reactive forms are based on ReactiveFormsModule, in a template-driven approach most of the logic is driven from the template whereas in reactive-driven approach the logic resides mainly in the component or typescript code.

We also saw the @Input and @Output decorators which are used as a way for bind data. The Input pass the data from the Father component to the Child component and the Output pass the data from the Child component to the Father component. We also saw the Dependency injection pattern which is also use to share data from one component to other component.The difference between input-output and dependency injection is that input-output can only share data between father and child components while dependency injection can share data between non related components.

# AtsPod5App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/home`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
